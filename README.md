The aim of the project is to analyse the impact of commercialisation of national parks in India. For the purpose of our analysis, we make use of the forest cover data to explore the evolution of forest areas in India over the years. Additionally, we use the Nighttime lights data to understand the economic activity in India over the years. The Forest Cover data and Nightlight data has been sourced from the SHRUG platform developed by Development Data Lab. The granularity of the data goes down till the village or the town level. Essentially, we have forest cover and nighttime lights data for each village/town of each sub district of each district of each state in India. We use other SHRUG data on location coding and coordinates to assist with plotting. The study explores these indicators mainly around two national parks : Jim Corbett National Park and Pench Tiger Reserve.
